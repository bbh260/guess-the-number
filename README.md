Number Guessing Game 

A fun and interactive Python game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game includes two difficulty levels: easy with 10 attempts and hard with 5 attempts. Players receive feedback after each guess to guide them closer to the correct number.

How It Works: 
Choose a difficulty level:

Easy: 10 attempts to guess the number. 
Hard: 5 attempts to guess the number.
Make a guess, and the program will guide you:

"Too High!" if the guess is greater than the number.
"Too Low!" if the guess is less than the number.
Win the game by guessing the correct number before running out of attempts.

Features :
1. Interactive gameplay with feedback on each guess.
2. Option to choose difficulty level.
3. Clear messages for both winning and losing scenarios.
